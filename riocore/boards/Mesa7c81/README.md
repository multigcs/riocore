# Mesa7c81
**Mesa7c81 over SPI - WIP**

The bitstream can be written via SPI, but you should have a USB Blaster handy so that you can flash via JTAG in an emergency.

It is also possible to operate this board with a W5500 via Ethernet, but flashing is then only possible via JTAG.

Smartserial is not supported by RIO, but the 2 ports can be used for Modbus.
